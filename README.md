Fun with N-Grams
John Wescott
1.	I decided to write this challenge in python as it was easier to set up a development environment for python as I am currently more familiar with it and am currently working as a frontend developer. 
2.	I went ahead and added removal of stop words to the program because it only took a minute. I went through every word and if it was a member of the list of stop words, I did not include it in the text to be used in the processing after.
3.	I will be honest, I am not sure what technology stack I would choose, because I am not too familiar with them or the thought processes that go into that type of decision making. If this code were to be used at a larger scale, I would re-write it in java as it would be faster. Java is a compiled language whereas python is interpreted, which means python code is compiled every time it is run making it slower. I would also consider implementing multithreading strategies as well as MapReduce. The algorithm I wrote is Linear, but multithreading would still lessen the processing time while using especially large datasets.
